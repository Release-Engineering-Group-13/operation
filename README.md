- operation does not have docker compose yet, so parts should be run individually
- model-training has removed the preprocessing, and uses pylint/dslinter and flake8 in a workflow.
- lib-ml is completely done as requested
- model-service does not fetch model from cloud yet, and the workflow doesn't work yet
- lib-version ...
- app does not use lib-version in the frontend yet
